Accruals to Time Bank
=====================

An Accrual is any benefit (usually time) that accrues on behalf of an employee over an extended
period of time. This can be vacation days, sick days, or a simple time bank. The actual policy
and mechanics of time bank accrual should be handled by other modules. This module only provides
the basic framework for recording the data. While this module's functionality overlaps with
Odoo's accrual leave allocations they are not the same and are not interchangeable.
